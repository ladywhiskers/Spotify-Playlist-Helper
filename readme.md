This is my version of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy">Goofy, written by Chimildic</a>. Detail about how to use and install is best found there, and I'm sure my changes can be reverse engineered.

My configuration for this is in the examples folder, feel free to have an explore. There are some minor additions in the library file, but most of the heavy lifting is performed by main.
